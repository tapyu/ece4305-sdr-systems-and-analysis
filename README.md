# ECE4305 Software Defined Radio Systems and Analysis

This repository contains the old lab homeworks of the course [ECE 4305: Software-Defined Radio Systems and Analysis](https://wpi.cleancatalog.net/electrical-and-computer-engineering/ece-4305). While the current lab homeworks can be easily found in its [`LabGuides` repository](https://github.com/sdrforengineers/LabGuides), I had a hard time to find the first set of lab homeworks. Luckly, such materials were available in other course: [EE 506 Fundamentals of Wireless Communications](https://courses.washington.edu/ee506/index.html), from University of Washington.

Therefore, I decided to create this repository to make them avaible for me and anyone else who is interested in this content.

> PS1: The Simulink files are in the old [`.mld` extension](https://fileinfo.com/extension/mdl), which was replaced by `.slx`.

> PS2: Each lab homework refers to a given chapter. I am not sure which book it is, but it is probably [Software-Defined Radio for Engineers](https://www.mathworks.com/campaigns/offers/download-rtl-sdr-ebook.html) as ECE4305 is heavily based on it.

> PS3: It seems that the ECE4305's initial hardware set up was based on USRP2.  USRP (short for Universal Software Radio Peripheral) is a specific brand and a serie of SDR devices developed by Ettus Research, which is a company of National Instruments. It is known for high flexibility, modularity, and performance, and suitable for professional and research applications, but it is more expansive than low-price SDR devices developed for hobbist and students, such as ADALM-PLUTO SDR and RTL-SDR. Howerver, the newest lab homeworks (see [`LabGuides`](https://github.com/sdrforengineers/LabGuides) show that ECE4305 is now adopting ADALM-PLUTO SDR. Therefore, you should refer to this device to implement the lab homeworks (the old documents refering to USRP2 are kept here for the sake of reference).
