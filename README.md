# ECE4305 Software Defined Radio Systems and Analysis

This repository contains the old computational homeworks of the course "[ECE 4305: Software-Defined Radio Systems and Analysis](https://wpi.cleancatalog.net/electrical-and-computer-engineering/ece-4305)". While the current computational homeworks can be easily found in its [`LabGuides` repository](https://github.com/sdrforengineers/LabGuides), I had a hard time to find the first set of computational homeworks. Luckly, such materials were available in other course: [EE 506 Fundamentals of Wireless Communications](https://courses.washington.edu/ee506/index.html), from University of Washington.

Therefore, I decided to create this repository to make them avaible for me and anyone else who is interested in this content.
